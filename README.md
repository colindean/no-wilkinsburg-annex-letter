# I Just Wanted To Vote Today

Disenfranchisement sucks. Let's tell legislators when it happens in new and old ways.

## Goals

1. Give people who need them the words to tell their state legislators that they
   had a bad experience while casting their vote.

That's it.

This is not the be-all-end-all. This is a one-night project done the night before
the 2016 U.S. presidential election. There are
[lots of ways it could be better](../../issues).

## Technical goals

1. It must load fast.
2. It must work on a wide range of browsers, especially mobile browsers.
3. It must be comprehensible to the widest possible audience.
4. It must be simple to use.
5. Its printed product must be readable and fit on one page by default.

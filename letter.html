              <p>8 November 2016</p>
              <p>Dear <span id="official-name">Legislator</span>:</p>
              <p>I write to inform you of my experience voting today at <span id="voting_location-response" class="voting-location">my precinct</span>.</p>
              <p>

                This wait time was <span id="acceptable-response" class="acceptable">frustrating</span>.

                I demand that you to take action to ensure that no voter is disenfranchised. Citizens' voices
                <em>must</em> be heard and any legislator who prevents someone from casting their vote should
                be removed from office. Any employer who prevents an employee from voting should be punished.

            <h2>Thank you</h2>
            <p>
              Your vote, regardless for whom it was cast, is vital to a functioning
              democracy in our constitutional republic.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you weren't able to vote, and if there is still time for you to
              vote, <em>please try again</em> and do not let
              anyone except a judge of elections or election constable stop you.
              Demand and write down the names of the people who prevent you from
              voting and call <a href="tel:1866OURVOTE">866-OUR-VOTE</a> to report it.
              Remember, though, that many
              states now require photographic identification.
            </p>
            <p>If you weren't able to vote, you were
              <abbr title="prevented from voting">disenfranchised</abbr> and you
              really should call <a href="tel:1866OURVOTE">866-OUR-VOTE</a> to report it in addition to sending
              this letter. Read more on the ACLU's
